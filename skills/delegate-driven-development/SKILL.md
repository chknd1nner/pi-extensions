name: delegate-driven-development
description: Use when executing an implementation plan end-to-end via delegated workers — orchestrates implementer → two-stage reviewer → fixer per ticket with a cached spec+plan prefix and non-blocking waits. Slots where subagent-driven-development would, but uses delegate_start workers instead of in-session subagents.

# Delegate-Driven Development (v2)

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the delegate-driven-development skill to orchestrate this plan."

You are the **orchestrator**. You own all ticket state and the pipeline. Workers are
stateless functions you dispatch via `delegate_start`; they report a structured footer
and you decide every transition. Design spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-31-delegate-driven-development-v2-design.md`.

## Core idea — cache the spec+plan prefix
`delegate_anchor` + `inherit_context` let every worker inherit a shared session prefix.
`buildSessionSnapshot` serializes the ENTIRE session branch from root to the anchor, so
prefix cleanliness depends on controlling what happens BEFORE the anchor — not on
selecting files. The prefix is exactly: `[system prompt][kickoff][full spec][full plan]`.
The first worker of each role pays to process it; later same-role workers hit cache.

**Cache correctness (non-negotiable):**
- Lock each role's `(provider, model)` for the whole run. Same system prompt + tool
  scope per role. The only sanctioned mid-run model switch is escalating a repeatedly
  failing task (see Escalation).

## Run setup (order matters — anchor FIRST)
1. Start in a fresh `/new` session; the kickoff message names the plan + spec paths.
2. **Anchor first, before any other tool call** (no worktree, no bash, no sharding):
   - `Read` the FULL spec to EOF (continue with `offset`/`limit`; `Read` truncates at
     ~2000 lines / 50KB — verify you reached EOF).
   - `Read` the FULL plan to EOF, same discipline.
   - `delegate_anchor({ name: "plan-foundation" })`.
   - If setup noise slipped in before the anchor, recover with `session_entries()` and
     `delegate_anchor({ name: "plan-foundation", entry_id })` at the correct entry.
3. Confirm the plan has `### Task N:` sections.
4. `using-git-worktrees` → create `.worktrees/<branch>` on a new feature branch; run
   project setup; verify a clean test baseline. Record the worktree path + branch name.
5. `ticket_shard(plan_path, spec_path)` → tickets land in `in-progress/ready/`.
6. Resolve role models: runtime args → `models.json` (beside this file). **Validate**
   every used role has non-empty `provider` and `model`; if not, halt and ask the user.

## Orchestration loop (sequential — one worker in flight)
For each ticket in `ready`, ascending task number:

1. `ticket_move task-NN active`. Record the diff boundary:
   `task_base_sha = git -C <worktree> rev-parse HEAD`; persist with
   `ticket_set task-NN task_base_sha <sha>`.
2. Build the implementer prompt = `references/implementer-prompt.md` with
   `{{PLAN_EXCERPT}}` (the ticket's `## Plan excerpt`), `{{WORKTREE_PATH}}`, `{{BRANCH}}`.
3. `delegate_start({ task, cwd: <worktree>, inherit_context: "plan-foundation",
   provider/model: implementer, thinking, tools: ["read","edit","write","bash"] })`.
4. **Wait (non-blocking):** launch `references/wait.sh <status_file> <timeout>` via the
   `process` tool with `alertOnSuccess: true`, `alertOnFailure: true`, and
   `logWatches: [{ pattern: "DELEGATE_WATCH_DONE|DELEGATE_WATCH_TIMEOUT" }]`. While
   waiting you MAY chat / investigate / pre-draft, but MUST NOT advance the pipeline,
   move the in-flight ticket, or edit worktree code.
5. On alert → `delegate_check` (authoritative) → `delegate_result`; parse `STATUS:`.
   - `BLOCKED` / `NEEDS_CONTEXT` → `ticket_move blocked`; stop and escalate to the user.
   - `DONE` / `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` → proceed to the commit-boundary gate.
6. **Commit-boundary gate (mandatory before EVERY review and re-review).** In the
   worktree, require `git rev-parse HEAD` ≠ `task_base_sha` AND `git status --porcelain`
   empty. If HEAD didn't advance or the tree is dirty, the task commit is missing —
   re-dispatch with an explicit "commit your work" instruction, or escalate. Do not
   review until this passes.
7. `ticket_move review`. Build the reviewer prompt = `references/reviewer-prompt.md`
   with `{{PLAN_EXCERPT}}`, `{{WORKTREE_PATH}}`, `{{TASK_BASE_SHA}}`. `delegate_start`
   with the reviewer model and READ-ONLY tools `["read","bash"]`,
   `inherit_context: "plan-foundation"`. Wait via the same non-blocking pattern.
8. On alert → `delegate_check` → `delegate_result`; parse `VERDICT:`.
   - `PASS` → `ticket_move done`; next ticket.
   - `FAIL` → write the reviewer's Fix Instructions to `next_prompt`
     (`ticket_set task-NN next_prompt <…>`); increment `review_failures`
     (`ticket_get` → +1 → `ticket_set`); go to Escalation.

## Escalation circuit-breaker (by `review_failures`)
- **1** → routine fixer run: build `references/fixer-prompt.md` with `{{PLAN_EXCERPT}}`
  and `{{FIX_INSTRUCTIONS}}` (read from `next_prompt`), `delegate_start` with the fixer
  model and tools `["read","edit","write","bash"]`, `inherit_context: "plan-foundation"`.
  After it reports, re-run the commit-boundary gate (step 6), then re-enter review (step 7).
- **2** → YOU (the strong orchestrator) investigate the root cause. If it is a
  fundamental spec/design flaw → stop and escalate to the user with findings. Otherwise
  dispatch fixer run #2 (optionally escalate the fixer model — a deliberate cache sacrifice).
- **3** → always stop and escalate to the user.

## Non-blocking wait details
Status files are best-effort; the watcher is only a trigger — `delegate_check` is
authoritative. On `DELEGATE_WATCH_TIMEOUT` with a still-`running` worker, decide whether
to relaunch the watcher, `delegate_steer`, or `delegate_abort`. Get the `status_file`
path from the `delegate_start` result details (or `delegate_check`).

## Worker roles & tools
| Role | Tools |
|---|---|
| Implementer / Fixer | `read`, `edit`, `write`, `bash` |
| Reviewer | `read`, `bash` (strictly read-only) |
Workers never get `ticket_*` or `delegate_*` and must never touch `in-progress/`.

## Completion
When all tickets are `done`: optionally run a whole-implementation reviewer pass over
the full feature-branch diff, then hand off to `finishing-a-development-branch` to
verify tests and present merge/PR/cleanup options.

## Out of scope (other skills/tools)
spec writing → `brainstorming`; plan writing → `writing-plans`; sharding → `ticket_shard`;
worktree setup → `using-git-worktrees`; merge/cleanup → `finishing-a-development-branch`.
